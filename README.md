# very-bad-old-website-design
A website from '95 with very bad design for a challenge to make a site like this.

Just a little fun, creating a bad website with the worst possible practices. I am sad &lt;blink&gt; tag doesn't work anymore. You can check out the site [here](https://akosnikhazy.github.io/very-bad-old-website-design/)
